    "Before actually characterizing the qubit, each of the TD drive have to be calibrated. This is because a TD signal is produced by mixing an LO output, which provides the carrier frequency, and outputs from AWGs, which are combined in mixers which are either (at least to my knowledge), single sideband (SSB), requiring a single IF input, or IQ, requiring 2. The SSB mixer calibration is more simply just optimization; simply ensure the output signal frequencies are well spaced in frequency and power. IQ calibration requires a little more, and the code iq_mixer_calibrate.py and iq_mixer_check.py are how we calibrate the IQ-mixed signals."

For the readout drive itself, we can simply test to see that the drive is being shaped properly. The code td_pulse_check.py emits and directly reads the waveform of the readout drive. You can customize it as you want, but seeing a square pulse in the resulting pop-up window should be enough for confirmation. This also obviously depends on the attenuation in the readout line; an output directly connected into the signal input gives a much clearer shape than one that has to go into the fridge, for example."

We then read out the qubit after. This detects qubit transitions that are directly related to the ground and shelving subspace of the qubit. In most cases, we are restricted to a very small sweep region, as we need to ensure that the mixing of the drive signal is maintained. However, in the case of a qubit frequency less than 1 GHz, we can directly drive the qubit using the AWG, which we do here."

The 2 state cannot decay back to 0 due to this protection, and instead decays to 1 via the shelving transition. This produces a (single) fluorescence photon, that we measure. \n",

We do another power and frequency sweep, this time around the 0-2 two photon expected frequency. Run the file td_2photongf_chevron_JPAPulsed.py, and observe the results. Not only should we be able to see a transition trace around the expected frequency, which shows up only beyond a certain power threshold, but we should also see some AC Stark shift, which is the gradual shift in the frequency of the 2-photon transition as the power increases."
